Greetings! My name is Agustin and I'm a software developer based on Valencia, Spain.

Although I mostly work on web applications I like learning new technologies and trying out new things.

Currently I'm using this blog to record troubleshoots for the challenges and I'm facing, as well as things I've found interesting. I hope you find something helpful here ðŸ˜ƒ

*I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe.*
